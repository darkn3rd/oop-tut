# A.1.1 Object Instantiation and Instance Method (Heap)
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates the following lessons:

 1. Instantiation (Creating an Object) on the heap
 2. Creating an instance method

This lesson shows how to create an object, a process called instantiation, where an object is an instance of a class in memory.  An instance method is created and can only be called when after an object is created in memory.

# Notes

The newly created object is now on the heap using `new` and can be removed from the heap using `delete`.  Naturally, when the program life is ended, all objects on the heap will be deleted.
