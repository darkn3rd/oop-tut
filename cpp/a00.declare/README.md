# A.0.0 Declaration (OOP Tutorial in C++)

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates the following lessons:

 1. Declaration a class
 2. Controlling access through ```private``` and ```public``` labels.
 3. Instantiation of an object on the stack
 4. Initialize private data through a mutator (setter) on object on the stack.
 5. Retrieve private data through a accessor (getter) on object on the stack.

# Notes

The class is created on the local stack and not in memory (heap).
