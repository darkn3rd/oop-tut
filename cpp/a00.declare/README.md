# A.0. Declaration (OOP Tutorial in C++)

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates the following lessons:

 1. Declare a class (on the stack).
 2. Initialize private data through a mutator (setter).
 3. Retrieve private data through a accessor (getter).

# Notes

The class is created on the local stack and not in memory (heap).
