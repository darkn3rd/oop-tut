# A.0.1 Instantiation
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates the following lessons:

 1. Instantiation an object on the heap.
 2. Initialize private data through a mutator (setter) on object in heap.
 3. Retrieve private data through a accessor (getter) on object in heap.

# Notes

Previously, the object was created on the local stack, and this tutorial shows how to create a new object on the heap.
