# B.2.0 Class Variables (OOP Tutorial in C++)

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates the following:

1. Create a class data member
2. Create a class member function
3. Calling a class member function

This tutorial introduces the concept of creating a data member that is always available, regardless of there there are any objects created.  These special data members can be called class variables, as they are available to the class.

In order to access this class, this tutorial also shows how to create a class accessible member function.  This is needed to access the class data when there are not objects of the class available.

## Notes

In C++, the facility to create data members and member functions that are available at the class level, we use the keyword ```static```.  Static varaibles and functions will always be accessible.
