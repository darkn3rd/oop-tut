# B.2.0 Overloading Constructors (OOP Tutorial in C++)
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates:

1. Overloading Constructors

There will be the following invariable constructors:

 * constructor without any parameters
 * constructor with one parameter of a string
 * constructor with one parameter of an int
 * constructor with two parameters of a string and an int.

## Notes

In traditional C language, you cannot have two functions with the same name.  In C++, you can have two functions with the same name, as long as they are not ambiguous, meaning that they need to have different variables.  When you pass in a different number of variables or different types of variables (or a combination of the two), C++ will select the appropriate function.
