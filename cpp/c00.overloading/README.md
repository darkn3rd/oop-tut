# B.2.0 Overloading Constructors (OOP Tutorial in C++)
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial introduces the concept of overloading through invariable constructors:

 * constructor without any parameters
 * constructor with one parameter of a string
 * constructor with one parameter of an int
 * constructor with two parameters of a string and an int.

## Notes

In traditional C language, you cannot have two functions with the same name.  In C++, you can have two functions with the same name, as long as they are not ambigious, meaning that they need to have different variables.  When you pass in a different number variables or type of variables, C++ will select the appropriate function.
