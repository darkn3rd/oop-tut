# B.2. Overloading Construcotrs (OOP Tutorial in C++)

## Purpose

This tutorial introduces the concept of overloading through invariable constructors:

 * constructor without any parameters
 * constructor with one parameter of string
 * constructor with two parameters of string and int.

## Notes

In traditional C language, you cannot have two functions with the same name.  In C++, you can have two functions with the same name, as long as they are not ambigious, meaning that they need to have different variables.  When you pass in a different number variables or type of variables, C++ will select the appropriate function.
