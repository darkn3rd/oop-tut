# B.0.0 Default Constructor (OOP Tutorial in C++)

## Purpose

This tutorial has the following lessons:

1. Create an object using a default constructor on the stack.

The default constructor will not initialize any data.  Instead, the mutator (setter) will be use to initialize any data.

# Notes

The class is created on the local stack and not in memory (heap).
