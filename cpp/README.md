## Status

This material is in it's infancy and only tested on Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8.5) . A basic makefile is included that is tested with clang that is bundled with XCode 5.1.1.

Working out types of lessons (use cases) for material that will work in C#, Java, Ruby, and Python.  Some experimentation with Objective-C as well.

## Terms

Data Members - fields, properties
Member Functions - methods
