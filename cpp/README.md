# OOP Tutorial in C++
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Status

This material is in it's infancy. A basic makefile is included that is tested with clang.

Working out types of lessons (use cases) for material that will work in C#, Java, Ruby, and Python.  Some experimentation with Objective-C as well.

## Tested

* Mac OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion), XCode 5.1.1 (Apple LLVM 5.1)
* Fedora 20 (Heisenbug), clang 3.4
  * iostream not found when using ```clang -stdlib=libc++```  

## Terms

Data Members - fields, properties
Member Functions - methods
