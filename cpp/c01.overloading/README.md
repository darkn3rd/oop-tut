**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates:

1. Overloading Constructors
2. Member Initialization List (C++ feature)

## Notes

The member initialization list is a feature that allows you to easily initialize variables.  Be careful that for any array or string, as any memory oriented structure needs to be validated before initialized.
