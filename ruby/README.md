## Status

This material is in its infancy.

The exact lessons (use cases) are still being developed.

## Terminology

The word ***accessor*** can mean either *retrieval* or *admittance*, and in the Ruby community, it is the later. In Ruby, an ***accessor*** gains *admittance* to *set* or *get* data from the class or object.  In order to distinguish between an *accessors* that *set* or *get* data, we can use the terms ***setters*** and ***getters***.
