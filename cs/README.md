**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Status

This material is in its infancy. A basic makefile is included that is tested with clang.

The exact lessons (use cases) are still being developed.

## Lessons

These are the current lessons devised thus far are the following

 1. Declaration and Instantiation
 2. Constructors and Destructors
 3. Overloading Constructors
 4. Class Variables (Static)
 5. Immutability
 6. Inheritance

## Usage

A basic make file is included and has been tested with clang on Heisenbug (Fedora 20) and Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8.5).  On these systems, simply do the following:

* Compiling Code: ```make```
* Running the Demonstration: ```./demo```
* Cleaning Up: ```make clean```

## Tested Systems

* Fedora 20 (Heisenbug)
  * Mono-Devel 0.3.10 from CentOS Repo
  * Nant 0.90-11.fc19 core dumps
  * Nant 0.92 compiled from source core dumps
