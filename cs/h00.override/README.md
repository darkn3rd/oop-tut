# H.0.0 Overriding
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates:

1. Overriding Methods
2. Using Protected
3. Type Coercion

This tutorial introduces the concept *overriding* methods, which is simply replacing the parent classes method with one of our own design.  In this demonstration, the parent class `Shape` has a `calculateArea()` that does nothing, and the child classes, `Triangle` and `Rectangle` override `calculateArea()` and have an implementation that makes sense to a triangle and a rectangle.

The tutorial introduces *protection* for fields.  The fields will be accessible to children classes, but inaccessible outside the class hierarchy.

This tutorial will show type coercion in Java, where integers are converted to a double.
