# OOP Tutorial in Objective-C
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Status

This material is in its infancy. A basic makefile is included that is tested with clang.

The exact lessons (use cases) are still being developed.

## Lessons

These are the current lessons devised thus far are the following

 1. :green_book: Declaration and Instantiation
 2. :green_book: Constructors

## Usage

A basic make file is included and has been tested Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8.5).  On these systems, simply do the following:

* Compiling Code: `make`
* Running the Demonstration: `./demo`
* Cleaning Up: `make clean`

## Tested Systems

* :dvd: Mac OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion)
  * :package:  XCode 5.1.1 (Apple LLVM 5.1)
  * :package:  XCode 5.1.1 Command Line Tools
