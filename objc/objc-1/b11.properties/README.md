# A.0.3 Declaration
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates the following lessons:

 1. Declare a class
    * Create a field (instance variable)
    * Create a property
 2. Create an object (Instantiation)
 3. Initialize object data using `object.name =` notation
 4. Retrieve information from Object using `= object.name` notation

This lesson shows how to access the property (getters and setters) using the dot `.` notation, rather than sending explicit messages of `name` and `setName`.

# Notes

It is best practice to name the fields managed by properties with an a leading underscore.

Thus for example, a property of `name` would have a corresponding field called `_name`, and a property of `age` would have a corresponding field called `_age`.
