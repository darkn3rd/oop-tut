# B.1.0 Custom Constructor
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates:

1. Define a class that supports initializing data at construction.
2. Create an object that instantiates an object with initialized data.

In this lesson, we create a custom constructor that accepts arguments to initialize field data.  This way we do not have to call numerous mutators (setters), and can instead initialize required data during the object's creation.

# Notes

In Objective-C, instead of having constructors, you have methods that initialize data.
