# B.2.0 Overloading Constructors (OOP Tutorial in C++)
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates:

1. Multiple Constructors

There will be the following constructor style methods that support:

 * constructor without any parameters
 * constructor with one parameter of a char*
 * constructor with one parameter of an int
 * constructor with two parameters of a char* and an int.

## Notes

In the C language, you cannot have two functions with the same name.  

In the Objective-C language, true overloading is not supported, but numerous  constructor styled methods, as long as they are named differently, or if they carry they same name, they support different messages.
