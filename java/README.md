 1. Declaration and Instantiation
 2. Constructors
 3. Overloading Constructors
 4. Class Variables (Static)
 5. Immutability (Final)

A basic make file is included and has been tested with clang on Heisenbug (Fedora 20) and Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8.5).  On these systems, simply do the following:

* Compiling Code: ```make```
* Running the Demonstration: ```make run```
* Cleaning Up: ```make clean```

## Tested Systems

* Fedora 20 (Heisenbug)
  * OpenJDK 1.8
  * OpenJDK 1.7
    * Ant 1.9.2
* OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion)
  * Apple JDK 1.6
    * Ant 1.8.2 (bundled with OS)
    * JUnit 4.1.0 (bundled with OS)
  * Oracle JDK 1.7
    * Ant 1.9.4 (homebrew)
    * JUnit 4.1.1 (downloaded)
