## Status

This material is in its infancy. A basic makefile is included.

The exact lessons (use cases) are still being developed.

## Lessons

These are the current lessons devised thus far are the following

 1. Declaration and Instantiation
 2. Constructors
 3. Overloading Constructors
    * Calling Designated Constructor (chaining with ```this()```)
 4. Class Variables (```static```)
 5. Immutability (```final```)
 6. Inheritance
    * Calling Parent's Constructor (```super()```)

Other topics I would like to cover shortly.

 * Overriding
 * Abstraction
 * Class-wide Constants ```static final```

## Usage

A basic makefile is included and has been tested on ***Heisenbug*** (Fedora 20) and ***Mountain Lion*** (OS X 10.8.5).  On these systems, simply do the following:

* Compiling Code: ```make```
* Running the Demonstration: ```make run```
* Cleaning Up: ```make clean```

## Tested Systems

* _**Fedora 20 (Heisenbug)**_
  * OpenJDK 1.8
  * OpenJDK 1.7
    * Ant 1.9.2
* *__OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion)__*
  * Apple JDK 1.6
    * Ant 1.8.2 (bundled with OS)
    * JUnit 4.1.0 (bundled with OS)
  * Oracle JDK 1.7
    * Ant 1.9.4 (homebrew)
    * JUnit 4.1.1 (downloaded)
