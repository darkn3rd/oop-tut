# A.1.0 Object Instantiation and Instance Method
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates the following lessons:

 1. Creating an instance method
 2. Instantiation (Creating an Object)
 3. Calling an object's instance method

This lesson shows how to create an object, a process called instantiation, where an object is an instance of a class in memory.  An instance method is created and can only be called when after an object is created in memory.
