# D.0.0 Class Variables
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates the following:

1. Create a class variable
2. Create a class method
3. Sending A Message for a class method

This tutorial introduces the concept of creating a class variable that is always available, regardless of there there are any objects created.

In order to access this class variable, we have to create a class method.

## Notes

To make the magic happen, the `static` keyword is used, so that this value will persist, regardless if there are zero or more objects created.
