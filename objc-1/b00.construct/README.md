# B.0.0 Default Constructor
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial has the following lessons:

1. Create an object using a default constructor on the stack.

The default constructor will not initialize any data.  Instead, the mutator (setter) will be use to initialize any data.

# Notes

Instead of using the actual implicit default constructor, we create one that does nothing more that report that object was created and a constructor was called.
