# A.0.1 Declaration
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates the following lessons:

 1. Declare a class
    * Create a field (instance variable)
    * Create methods:
      * Accessor to get data
      * Mutator to set data
 2. Create an object (Instantiation)
 3. Initialize object data
 4. Retrieve information from Object

This tutorial is different in that the accessor and mutator share the same name as the data they get and set.

# Notes

All fields in Objective-C default to `protected` and are thus only accessible by this class and derived (children) classes.
