## Status

This is a tutorial of the Objective-C using the generic `objc/Object` library.  As this library is antiquated, it uses the limited features Objective-C version 1.

## Overview

The wikipedia [article](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) on Objective-C:

* http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C

## Installation

Here are some [Installation Instructions](INSTALL.md) that will help configure and setup an Objective-C environment with the Foundation Libraries.  
## Lessons

These are the current lessons devised thus far are the following

 1. :green_book: Declaration and Instantiation
 2. :green_book: Constructors
    * :page_facing_up: Default Constructors vs. Custom Constructors
 3. :closed_book: Overloading Constructors ***ALTERNATIVE***
    * :page_facing_up: Constructor Chaining to Delegated Constructor
 4. :green_book: Class Variables
 5. :closed_book: Immutability ***ALTERNATIVE***
 6. :green_book: Inheritance
    * :page_facing_up: Using parent methods
    * :page_facing_up: Using `super()`

## Usage

A basic make file is included and has been tested Mountain Lion (OS X 10.8.5).  On these systems, simply do the following:

* Compiling Code: `make`
* Running the Demonstration: `make run`
* Cleaning Up: `make clean`

## Tested Systems

* :dvd: Mac OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion)
  * :package:  XCode 5.1.1 (Apple LLVM 5.1)
  * :package:  XCode 5.1.1 Command Line Tools
