# Object-Oriented-Programming Tutorial
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

Welcome to my material for tutoring OOP concepts.  This material extracts common OOP concepts and functionality from C++, C#, and Java programming languages.  Then I see how I could apply these concepts to Objective-C, Python, and Ruby.

***Last Update***: November 17th, 2014

## Topics

These are the topics ironed out so far (still under development):

* :books: Declaration and Instantiation (A00)
* :books: Construction (Initialization)
   * :green_book: Default Constructor (B00)
   * :green_book: Constructor with parameters (B10)
   * :green_book: Destructor (B20)
* :books: Overloading Constructors (C00)
   * :green_book: Delegated Constructor (C10)
* :books: Class Variables
   * :green_book: Class or Static Method (D00)
* :books: Immutable Fields (D10)
* :books: Inheritance (E00)
  * :green_book: Parent's Constructor (E10)

These topics are in total brainstorming mode:

* :books: Overloading
   * :green_book: Mutators
   * :green_book: Operators
   * :green_book: Type Coercion
* :books: Overriding
* :books: Abstraction
* :books: Interface

## Tasks

### Recent Stuff

* [x] Try compiles on Linux (Fedora 20)
  * [x] C++ v11
  * [x] Java 8
  * [x] C# (mono)
* [x] C++ - Complete 11 lessons for 4 topic areas.
* [x] Java - Complete 6 lessons for 4 topic areas.
* [x] C# - Complete 6 lessons for 4 topic areas.
* [x] Python - Complete 9 lessons for 4 topic areas.
  * [x] Find alternatives to immutability and overloading
* [x] Ruby - Complete 6 lessons for 4 topic areas.
  * [x] Find alternatives to immutability and overloading

### Near Future

* [ ] Build Material Objective-C.
  * [ ] Test material on Linux.
* [ ] Experiment with default variables as alternative to overloading on C#, C++, and Java.
* [ ] Use any convenience facility in Python and Ruby for setters/getters.
* [ ] Determine why Nant 0.9.2 is core dumping on Fedora 20 with Mono 3.4
* [ ] Develop Nant build scripts, Explore XBuild (MSBuild) scripts.
* [ ] Design consistent build strategy for all languages, such as `build/` directory.
* [ ] Brainstorm more advanced OOP material with abstractions, virtual, interface, boxing, etc.
* [ ] Test on other platforms: Windows versions, Mac OS X versions, Linux Distros

### Far Future (total brainstorm)

* :bulb: Experiment with various Unit test platforms.
  * :bulb: Consider using same code base in interactive mode, maybe create an *unit-tut* repository.
* :bulb: Build more robust cross-platform build scripts (as needed, if needed)
* :bulb: Design Patterns? Modeling?
* :bulb: Other languages? (Go, Rust, Perl, PHP)
* :bulb: Other platforms? (Solaris distros, BSD distros)
