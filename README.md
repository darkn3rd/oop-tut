# Object-Oriented-Programming Tutorial
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

Welcome to my material for tutoring OOP concepts.  This material extracts common OOP concepts and functionality from C++, C#, and Java programming languages.  Then I see how I could apply these concepts to Objective-C, Python, and Ruby.  Maybe some other languages could be added later like Go, Rust, or Groovy.

## Topics

These are the topics ironed out so far (still under development)

### Part I  Introduction

This is a simple HelloWorld class and object.

* :books:
  * :green_book: Declaration and Class Method (A00)
  * :green_book: Instantiation and Instance Method (A10)

### Part II Mechanics

This uses a Person and Student metaphor, where Student is a type of a Person.

* :books: Instance Variables and Accessors
  * :green_book: Accessors and Mutators (B00)
  * :green_book: Properties (B10)
* :books: Construction (Initialization)
   * :green_book: Default Constructor (C00)
   * :green_book: Constructor with parameters (C10)
   * :green_book: Destructor (C20)
* :books: Overloading Constructors (D00)
   * :green_book: Delegated Constructor (D10)
* :books: Class Variables
   * :green_book: Class or Static Method (E10)
* :books: Immutable Fields (F00)
* :books: Inheritance (G00)
  * :green_book: Parent's Constructor (G10)

### Part III

These topics are in total ***brainstorming*** mode.  

These features are starting to vary, as invocation oriented OOP languages support some notion of *abstraction* or *interfaces*, while inspection oriented OOP languages may not support such features.

* :books: Overriding (H00)
* :books: Abstraction (I00)
* :books: Interface (J00)

### Status

I am making a ad-hoc task list [TASK.MD](TASKS.MD) to track my research and activities of this project.
