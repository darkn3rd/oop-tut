## Usage

These programs were edited in [Dart editor](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/download.html) or [Atom](https://atom.io/), and ran using the Dart editor.  

## Tested Systems

* :dvd: *__OS X 10.8.5 (Mountain Lion)__*
  * :package: Dart Editor 1.8.3 ([darteditor-macos-ia32.zip](https://storage.googleapis.com/dart-archive/channels/stable/release/latest/editor/darteditor-macos-ia32.zip))


Note: For testing the JavaScript, similar platforms were used with JavaScript.

## Install Notes

### OS X 10.8.5 (*Mountain Lion*)

These instructions were tested on December 10, 2014.

The [download page instructions](https://www.dartlang.org/tools/download.html) for using Homebrew on for Dart is ***BROKEN***.  It will fail when it tries to install gtest.  

The standalone application [Dart Editor](https://www.dartlang.org/docs/tutorials/get-started/) seems to work.  There are binaries found in `/Applications/dart/dart-sdk/bin` that can be added to the path.
