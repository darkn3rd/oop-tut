## Overview

These are ad-hoc notes and tasks to help keep track of where I am at.

## Topics



### Part III

* :books: Sealing/Final Methods
* :books: Method Hiding
* :books: Abstract and Interface Fields
* :books: Overloading
   * :green_book: Methods
   * :green_book: Operators
   * :green_book: Type Coercion

## Tasks

### Recent Stuff

* [x] Testing on Fedora 20: C++, Java 8, C#, Objective-C
* [x] Complete Part II (6 lessons): C++, Java, Objective-C, C#, Python, Ruby
* [x] Complete Part I (Declare, Instantiate): C#, C++, Objective-C, Java, Python, Ruby
* [x] Complete Part III (Overriding, Abstract, Interface)
  * [x] C#, [x] Java, [x] C++, [x] Objective-C, [x] Python, [x] Ruby

### Near Future

* [ ] Develop Objective-C Material
  * [x] Objective-C 1 (Object)
    * [ ] Test on Linux
  * [ ] Objective-C 2 w/ Foundation (Cocoa)
    * [ ] Test on Linux (GNUStep)
* [ ] Ruby, Python - manual properties
* [ ] Python decorators, `@property`
* [ ] Ruby: `attr_reader`, `attr_writer` and `attr_accessor`
* [ ] Simulate Properties with Java Lambda block
* [ ] Determine why Nant 0.9.2 is core dumping on Fedora 20 with Mono 3.4
* [ ] Develop Nant build scripts, Explore XBuild (MSBuild) scripts.
* [ ] Design consistent build strategy for all languages, such as `build/` directory.
* [ ] Brainstorm more advanced OOP material with abstractions, virtual, interface, boxing, etc.
* [ ] Test on other platforms (Win, Unix, Lin Distros)

### Far Future (total brainstorm)

* :bulb: Experiment with various Unit test platforms.
  * :bulb: Consider using same code base in interactive mode, maybe create an *unit-tut* repository.
* :bulb: Build more robust cross-platform build scripts (as needed, if needed)
* :bulb: Design Patterns? Modeling?
* :bulb: Other languages? (Go, Rust, Perl, PHP)
* :bulb: Other platforms? (Solaris distros, BSD distros)
