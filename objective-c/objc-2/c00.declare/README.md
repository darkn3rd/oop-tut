# B.0.0 Instance Variable and Accessors
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates the following lessons:

1. Declare a class with the following
* an field (instance variable)
* two methods to get and set data
* Create an object (Instantiation)
* Initialize object data using accessor
* Retrieve instance variable values using accessor

# Notes

In the Objective-C community, accessors (getters and setters) are called `name` and `setName` for the getter and setter for a `protected` instance variable called `_name`.  This is different than other languages, where the getter would be called `getName`.
