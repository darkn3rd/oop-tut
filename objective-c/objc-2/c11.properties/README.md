# B.1.1 Instance Variable and Properties
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates the following lessons:

1. Declare a class with the following
   * a field (instance variable)
   * a property for instance variable
* Create an object (Instantiation)
* Initialize object data using accessor
* Retrieve instance variable values using property

# Notes

When creating a property in Objective-C, you can access the instance variable using the dot `.` notation, and assign the instance variable using the assignment operator `=`.  This will use the property which calls the appropriate getter and setter.
