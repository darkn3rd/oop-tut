# B.1.0 Instance Variable and Properties
**© 2014 by Joaquín Menchaca**

## Purpose

This tutorial demonstrates the following lessons:

1. Declare a class with the following
   * a field (instance variable)
   * a property for instance variable
* Create an object (Instantiation)
* Initialize object data using accessor
* Retrieve instance variable values using implicit accessors

# Notes

When creating a property in Objective-C, the getters and setters are automatically created with the names of `name` and `setName`.
