## Overview

This is my cumulative installation guide to getting scripting languages for your platform.

### Required Knowledge

You wil need intermediate knowledge of the operating system and shell environment (configuration, environment variables, path, symbolic links, etc.), checking in/out code, compiling code, and installing packages.

Additionally, you should have intermediate programming skills for class-based OOP to make sense.  This includes variables, arrays, structures (records), hashes, logic flow (control and branch constructs), sub-routines (procedures) and functions, pointers, references, scope (local vs. outer vs. global).  Also, you'll need to understand concepts like stack vs. heap, memory management, and some inkling about what's taking place under the hood (in virtual machine or runtime engine).

## Tested Operating Systems

These scripts have been tested sporadically on the following operating systems:

* ***Linux***
  * :dvd: **Cent OS 6.5**
